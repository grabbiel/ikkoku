# Manifest-driven verification lanes

Reviewed 2026-09-26 (T-T04 / E-T03 / CMT-11). Run every command from the
repository root. `Tools/verification/run.py` is a stdlib-only Python runner:
it executes the checks declared in a lane manifest, parses per-test results,
and writes one JSON report under the git-ignored `.local/` tree. It never
starts a CI job, downloads anything, or runs commands through a shell.

## Usage

```sh
# Public lane — safe without any private data:
python3 Tools/verification/run.py --manifest Tools/verification/lanes/public.json

# Private-source lane — the one Engine-suite check declares 47 fixture
# variables, all `"optional": true`, so it runs whatever is supplied.
# Without an environment file it runs with none supplied and lists
# everything under `missingFixtures` (a supplied-but-unreadable path
# still fails the check):
python3 Tools/verification/run.py --manifest Tools/verification/lanes/private-source.json

# With --strict, any missing declared fixture — optional or not — fails
# the check instead of merely recording it as missing:
python3 Tools/verification/run.py --manifest Tools/verification/lanes/private-source.json --strict

# With real fixtures supplied (paths only; keep the file in .local/):
python3 Tools/verification/run.py --manifest Tools/verification/lanes/maker.json \
  --environment .local/verification/environment.json
```

Options: `--environment PATH` (JSON file providing declared fixture paths; must stay in `.local/`), `--report PATH` (must stay under `.local/verification/`; an existing file is never overwritten), `--strict` (fails a check if any declared fixture is missing), and `--timeout SECONDS` (default 240 per check, overridable per check via `timeout`).

## Environment isolation

Each check inherits the shell environment with every `IKKOKU_*` variable removed, then receives only its declared fixtures supplied by the environment file, followed by its own `env` settings; `--strict` also sets `IKKOKU_REQUIRE_SOURCE_FIXTURES=1`. The environment file holds fixture paths only; capture and UI settings belong in the check's `env`.

## Manifest schema (schemaVersion 2)

Each manifest is `{"schemaVersion": 2, "checks": [...]}` and every check needs:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique check name; used as the log file name. |
| `argv` | Executed directly (no shell). A missing program fails the check. |
| `fixtures` | `{"env": "IKKOKU_*", "kind": "file"\|"directory", "optional"?: bool, "from"?: "IKKOKU_*"}` — paths come **only** from the `--environment` JSON map (default `{}`), never from the shell. A MISSING **required** fixture skips the whole check (`FAILED` under `--strict`); a missing `optional` one is recorded in `missingFixtures` and the check runs anyway, so a suite runs with whatever fixtures exist. A supplied-but-unreadable path always FAILS. Directory fixtures are hashed as a bounded tree (≤4096 entries, ≤512 MiB). `from` selects the environment-file KEY whose value fills `env`, so one check can supply a different scene file under the same variable the program reads (the aliased value is what gets hashed into `suppliedFixtures`, recorded with its `from`); a missing alias skips/fails the check naming `env`. |
| `env` | Fixed non-secret settings merged over the environment map. Only `IKKOKU_*` keys; `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` are rejected. |
| `minimumTests` / `maximumSkipped` | Bounds on the parsed results. `minimumTests` counts EXECUTED tests (passed + failed). PR #4 supplies named per-test fixture skips, which the lanes report; earlier `guard let env … else { return }` tests appeared as executed passes without their data. Read per-test names and skips before claiming source-data coverage. |
| `referenceTier` | One of `synthetic`, `recovered-code-oracle`, `original-managed-dll`, `original-player-probe`, `app-smoke`; any other value rejects the manifest. A tier is declared metadata; the runner never infers it. |
| `tolerance` | Optional free text telling readers what the check does **not** prove. |
| `artifacts` | Files hashed AFTER the run (built binaries, generated reports). A missing artifact fails the check. Paths must stay inside the repository. |
| `timeout` | Per-check override of `--timeout`, in seconds. |

## Reference tiers

Tiers bound what a check can support: `synthetic` (generated fixtures only),
`recovered-code-oracle` (a checked-in independent oracle over recovered
logic), `original-managed-dll` (a recovered managed assembly is executed),
`original-player-probe` (a controlled copy of the original player was run),
and `app-smoke` (the built app binary was executed headlessly). None of
them claims whole-game parity; read each `tolerance`.

## Lanes

| Lane | Checks | Status 2026-09-26 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public.json` | Engine `swift test`, mod-tools / translation / runner-self / studio-validator `unittest` suites | 5/5 checks pass (Engine `swift test` runs 369 tests, plus Python suites). Gated Swift tests use PR #4 named skips; without PR #4, early returns would report as executed passes. |
| `private-source.json` | One `engine-source-suite` check declaring every `IKKOKU_*` variable gated in `Packages/Engine/Tests` except `…_OUTPUT/_REPORT/_RESULT`, `IKKOKU_SAVE_SCENE` and `IKKOKU_EXPORT_SOURCE_SCENE` — all marked `optional` so the suite runs with whatever exists | Runs with or without an environment file; unsupplied fixtures are recorded per check and only fail under `--strict`. With 32 local fixtures supplied on the integrated tree, Engine runs 379 tests: 359 passed, 20 named skips (via PR #4), 0 failed. |
| `maker.json` | Seven Swift `--filter` checks over converted Maker/card/material data plus `card_roundtrip.py` / `maker_roundtrip.py` audits | 6 checks pass (47 executed tests) and 3 skip: one Swift check skips because `IKKOKU_APPEARANCE_REFERENCE_ROOT` exceeds the 512 MiB hash bound when supplied; both roundtrip audits declare their real prerequisites (`IKKOKU_MANAGED_RECOVERY_EXPORT`, `IKKOKU_MAKER_COMPLETION_INPUTS`) as fixtures and skip with named reasons while absent — nothing shipped here fails on the reference machine. |
| `app-smoke.json` | Debug `xcodebuild` build (built binary hashed as artifact), headless Mute-startup run, then two ordered checks: `studio-inspector-capture` runs the Debug app expecting the source-pose report; `studio-inspector-validate` runs `Tools/verification/checks/studio_inspector_report.py` against that JSON | Debug build passes; `startup-mute-capture` skips (3 plugin fixtures absent locally); `studio-inspector-capture` and `studio-inspector-validate` pass when PR #5 UI report hooks are merged (report confirms `SourcePoseInspector observed == expected`), but fail with a clear missing-report result on this branch without PR #5, as stated in their tolerance text. |
| `studio-scenarios.json` | Twelve `app-smoke` checks, each running the Debug app binary with `IKKOKU_STUDIO_SCENARIO` pointed at one scenario JSON under `Tools/verification/scenarios/` (see below) | 12/12 checks passed 2026-09-29 with `IKKOKU_SOURCE_AVATAR` (+`IKKOKU_STUDIO_ITEM_CATALOG` for props) supplied; every check fills `IKKOKU_SOURCE_SCENE` through the fixture `from` key: the six character scenarios (including `undo-props`) from `IKKOKU_STUDIO_SCENARIO_SCENE` (`koikatu_cs0002591.png`), the camera scenarios (`camera-*`, `undo-camera`) alias `IKKOKU_SOURCE_SCENE` from `IKKOKU_CAMERA_OBJECT_PROBE_SCENE` (scene-x) and the route scenarios (`route-play-state`, `undo-route`) from `IKKOKU_ROUTE_PROBE_SCENE`; every scenario report and exported scene hashed as an artifact. |

## Studio scenario hook (T-T04)

When the app starts with `IKKOKU_STUDIO_SCENARIO` set, `AppState` runs a
headless scenario instead of the auto-capture path and exits itself
(0 when every step passed, 1 otherwise) — `IKKOKU_AUTOCAPTURE` is not
needed in that mode. The variable names a JSON file (`Tools/verification/
scenarios/*.json`, resolved against the check's cwd, the repo root)
holding `{"steps": [...]}`; `IKKOKU_STUDIO_SCENARIO_REPORT` is required
and names the JSON report to write (`{"steps":[{"op","ok","detail"}],
"passed","failed"}`). Objects are addressed by SOURCE KEY
(`sourceObjectKey`), never by runtime UUIDs; numeric compares use a 1e-5
tolerance. A failing `assert`/edit step is recorded and the run
continues; a failing `export`/`reimport` stops it. Both write only under
`.local/`. Ops: `select`, `setVisible`, `rename`, `toggleCamera`,
`toggleRoute`, `undo`, `redo`, `newScene`, `setFace`, `setBody`
`{key,index,value}`, `setColor` `{key,id,rgba[4]}`, `export`/`reimport`
`{path}`, and `assert` with any of `name`, `visible`, `face`/`body`
`{index,value}`, `color` `{id,rgba}`, `activeCamera` (key or null),
`routePlaying` `{key,playing}`, `sourceRuntime`
`{cameras,items,routes,sceneLight}` (each sub-key optional; counts the
live entries of the SHA-gated source runtime caches — a step's
`assert`/`sourceRuntime` was added for ST-T15 to pin that undo/redo/New
Scene keep a source scene's props, cameras, routes and light),
`diagnosticContains`. The runner closes the editor's 0.4 s
edit-coalescing window (`StudioModel.endUndoCoalescing()`) before every
step, so each step takes its own undo snapshot however fast the steps run;
without it, startup's forced import `pushUndo` made the first edit's
snapshot load-dependent. The scenarios cover the
automatable halves of the Studio checklist in
`docs/component-audit/README.md`; each check's `tolerance` says exactly
which checklist claims (live visuals, CharaStudio reload, unbound hair
color writeback) stay unchecked.

No `studio-scenarios` check reads the environment file's own `IKKOKU_SOURCE_SCENE`
(the `app-smoke` and `private-source` lanes use it for a different
scene). Each check aliases it through the fixture `from` key instead.
The six character scenarios (`visibility-folder`, `rename-folder`,
`face-shape`, `color-edit`, `item-props`, `undo-props`) take
`IKKOKU_STUDIO_SCENARIO_SCENE`, which must be the scene whose object
keys they address (`koikatu_cs0002591.png`: keys 0, 65 and 622). That
scene has neither a camera nor a route-bearing object, so the six
camera/route scenarios take a probe scene: `camera-load-winner`,
`camera-deactivate`, `camera-rename` and `undo-camera` run against the
two-active-camera scene-x (`IKKOKU_CAMERA_OBJECT_PROBE_SCENE`),
`route-play-state` and `undo-route` against the scene with two
saved-active routes (`IKKOKU_ROUTE_PROBE_SCENE`).

```sh
# Build Debug first, then (needs the five private fixture paths — scenario
# scene, avatar, item catalog, camera probe scene, route probe scene — in
# .local/verification/environment.json):
python3 Tools/verification/run.py \
  --manifest Tools/verification/lanes/studio-scenarios.json \
  --environment .local/verification/environment.json --strict
```

A declared `artifacts` entry is hashed only AFTER the run — an artifact
the check never produced (or an oversized one) FAILS the check, e.g.
`studio-inspector-capture` while the PR #5 hooks are absent, or
`build-debug-app` if the build itself fails.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request to `main`, every push to
`main` and on manual dispatch. It runs two jobs on GitHub-hosted `macos-26`
runners (the app's deployment target is macOS 26, so it needs Xcode 26):

- `public-lane` builds the Engine tests (`swift build --build-tests`, so the
  lane's 600 s `swift test` timeout does not include a cold build), then runs
  `public.json` **without `--strict`**. Fixture-gated Swift tests report named
  skips instead of failing; the report and per-check logs are uploaded as the
  `public-lane-report` artifact.
- `app-build` builds `IkkokuCreator` Debug with code signing disabled
  (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`), because the runner has no development-team
  identity. It checks that the app compiles and links, and nothing more.

The `private-source`, `maker`, `app-smoke` and `studio-scenarios` lanes stay
local: they need the original installation, `.local/` fixtures or the
Parallels VM. A green CI run therefore says nothing about source-data parity or
app behavior; record the local lane results in the pull request as before. The
workflow does not gate merges (no required status check).

The jobs use the runner image's default Xcode, which can be newer than the
reference machine's (Xcode 26.6 on the `macos-26-arm64` 20260907 image
against 26.0.1 locally on 2026-09-29). CI therefore also catches compiler
differences: its first run found a heterogeneous array literal in
`SourceStudioWorldTransformTests.swift` that Xcode 26.6 no longer infers as
`[SIMD3<Float>]`.

## Report fields

A report records `git.revision`, the dirty flag and the sha256 of
`git diff HEAD` when dirty; the runner path+sha256; the manifest path and
sha256; `swift`/`xcodebuild`/`python3` versions (absent tools report
`null`); and per check: argv, cwd, `passedEnvironment` with the sorted
`IKKOKU_*` names actually passed, `env` with values only for the check's own
settings, `suppliedFixtures`/`missingFixtures` with paths and hashes,
`referenceTier`, `tolerance`, artifact hashes taken **after** the run (a
missing artifact fails the check), exit code, elapsed seconds, and the log
path plus its hash.
Reports and logs live under the git-ignored `.local/verification/`.
`Tools/verification/environment.example.json` carries placeholder paths
only; real values belong in your git-ignored `.local/verification/environment.json`.
The `IKKOKU_IK_APP_ENVIRONMENT` fixture points to a JSON file path containing an object mapping `IKKOKU_SOURCE_SCENE`, `IKKOKU_EXPORT_SOURCE_SCENE`, and `IKKOKU_SAVE_SCENE` to files written by an earlier headless IK app capture, rather than to game data.
